# Running the sample on a local dev sequencer

What this run proves on a real sequencer: the deployer gate, the admin check, the three hops to a target, the handover and renounce, and that each refused call carries its code both in the wallet's simulation and on chain.

## 1. Sequencer

In a LEZ checkout at tag `v0.4.0-rc3`, inside `nix develop`:

```sh
just clean
RISC0_DEV_MODE=1 just run-sequencer-standalone     # 127.0.0.1:3040, no proving
```

Leave it running. A refused transaction's text appears in this terminal.

## 2. Wallet

In a second terminal, same checkout, same `nix develop`:

```sh
export LEE_WALLET_HOME_DIR=$PWD/lez/wallet/configs/debug
just run-wallet check-health                 # sets the wallet password after `just clean`
just wallet-import-test-accounts             # two genesis-funded accounts, take the first as PAYER
```

## 3. Guest binary

From this repo, with the risc0 toolchain installed through `rzup`:

```sh
cargo build --release --manifest-path sample/methods/Cargo.toml
ls sample/methods/target/riscv-guest/sample-methods/sample/riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf/release/sample.bin
```

## 4. Run

With the same `LEE_WALLET_HOME_DIR`, and `r0vm` on the `PATH`: the wallet runs each call through it before sending.

```sh
cargo run --release -p sample-runner -- \
  sample/methods/target/riscv-guest/sample-methods/sample/riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf/release/sample.bin \
  <PAYER>
```

The runner prints the program, deployer, config, stranger and nominee account ids, one `included in block` line per step with the gas the wallet declared, and the config read back after each step. A step the guard must refuse first prints `refused in simulation with E<code>`, then goes on chain anyway. The runner stops at the first step that does not behave.

## 5. What to look for

- The deployment: one transaction per segment, then the header.
- Five refused steps: `stranger init` with E117, `stranger`, `nominee before accept` and `old admin` with E103, `after renounce` with E102. Each declares the whole 2,000,000 gas budget, and its read-back is unchanged.
- `after init`: the admin slot held by the deployer, both values 0.
- `the target's state`: `TargetState { value: 5 }` on the stranger's account.
- In the sequencer terminal, each refused transaction's text with its code. The guest's panic line also prints in the runner's terminal, once per simulation.

## If something fails

- `SegmentChain(CountMismatch { .. })`: the runner counts segments from the user ELF inside the program binary. Report the numbers.
- `UnadmittedPublicActor`: the wallet did not attach the config PDA's evidence. Report it, that is a finding about `PublicPda` mentions.
- `SimulatedRevert` on a step that should pass: the error carries the refusal text. Report it.
- `Transaction not found in preconfigured amount of blocks`: the sequencer dropped the transaction, which is its fee screening or an invalid input, not a revert. Check the payer's balance.
- A panic in the runner about `r0vm`: put it on the `PATH`.
