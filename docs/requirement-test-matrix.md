# Requirement-to-test matrix, RFP-001 on LEZ 0.4

Every hard requirement of [RFP-001](https://github.com/logos-co/rfp/blob/main/RFP-001-admin-authority-lib.md) and every scenario of the proposal, with what satisfies it in this repo and in [lez-authority](https://github.com/mmlado/lez-authority). Test names are exact. `sample` names a test in [`sample/src/main.rs`](../sample/src/main.rs), `minimal` one in [`sample-minimal/src/main.rs`](../sample-minimal/src/main.rs), `engine` one in lez-authority's `src/lib.rs`, and `runner` a step of [`sample/runner`](../sample/runner/src/main.rs) as run on a local dev sequencer at LEZ `7e3f7f7` on 2026-10-26. Regenerate the coverage claim with `cargo test --workspace --exclude sample-runner --locked` here and `cargo test --workspace --locked` in lez-authority.

## Hard requirements, Functionality

| # | Requirement | Satisfied by | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | Admin authority is set at program initialisation | sample `init_through_the_seat_installs_the_sender_as_admin`, `with_a_genesis_key_that_key_installs_itself`, engine `the_deployer_installs_itself_and_the_slot_must_stay_that_way`, `with_a_genesis_key_only_that_key_installs`, runner `init` | test, run |
| F2 | Admin authority can transfer to a new signer | sample `the_admin_nominates_and_nothing_moves_yet`, `the_nominee_accepts_and_the_old_admin_is_out`, `a_pda_nominee_accepts_through_its_program_with_the_seed`, engine `nominate_records_replaces_and_cancels`, `a_key_nominee_accepts_at_top_level`, runner `nominate`, `accept`, `new admin setter`, `old admin` | test, run |
| F3 | Admin authority can revoke, renouncing control | sample `renounce_empties_the_slot_and_keeps_the_values`, `a_renounced_admin_refuses_every_change`, `init_after_renounce_is_refused`, `renounce_drops_the_nomination_too`, engine `accept_after_renounce_is_refused`, `unset_and_renounced_slots_refuse_everyone`, runner `renounce`, `after renounce` | test, run |
| F4 | Only the admin calls privileged instructions | sample `the_admin_sets_the_admin_value`, `a_signed_stranger_cannot_set_the_admin_value`, `an_admin_message_sent_straight_to_the_config_is_refused`, `a_change_entered_from_another_program_is_refused`, `a_pda_admin_cannot_act_at_top_level`, minimal `a_stranger_is_refused`, engine `a_key_holder_acts_at_top_level_only`, runner `stranger`, `nominee before accept` | test, run |

## Hard requirements, Usability

| # | Requirement | Satisfied by | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U1 | Integrated so that programs enable it with minimal boilerplate | Level 1: a slot field with `HasSlot<Admin>`, two or three hosted variants with `Hosts`, one `require_admin` per admin-only arm, `guard` around the handler. `sample-minimal` and `ci/consumer-fixture` are the whole integration. The RFP names SPEL: the 0.4 libraries are SPEL-independent by request, and level 2 (macros) and level 3 (SPEL) are planned, not started | sample, design |
| U2 | One admin at a time | `AuthoritySlot::Held` carries one `Holder`. sample `the_nominee_accepts_and_the_old_admin_is_out` asserts the old admin loses access the moment the new one has it | design, test |
| U3 | An end-to-end usage example in the docs | README integration steps and transaction shapes, `sample`, [`sample/RUN.md`](../sample/RUN.md) with the runner | doc, sample |

## Hard requirements, Performance

| # | Requirement | Satisfied by | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Document the overhead of the check on a gated instruction | [`docs/overhead.md`](overhead.md), cycle counts per hop and per operation from `sample/methods/tests/overhead.rs`, and the transaction shape in the README | doc, measurement |

## Hard requirements, Supportability

| # | Requirement | Satisfied by | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | CI green on the default branch | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (fmt, clippy, tests, consumer check), `audit.yml`, `consumer-build.yml` (guests and the runner), in both repos | ci |
| S2 | Every hard requirement has a test | this matrix | doc |
| S3 | A README with dependency and integration steps | README, Adding as a dependency and Integration steps | doc |
| S4 | A sample program that imports the library | `sample`, `sample-minimal`, `ci/consumer-fixture` | sample |

## Soft requirement, Reliability

| # | Requirement | Satisfied by | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | The admin can only be set to a valid new signer, on-curve key or deployed PDA | On 0.4 the nominee installs itself by accepting through its own seat, so an account that cannot authorize a transaction never becomes admin: sample `an_unsigned_sender_is_refused_at_its_seat`, `only_the_nominee_accepts`, `a_pda_nominee_without_the_seed_is_refused`, engine `a_pda_nominee_with_the_wrong_seed_is_refused`, `a_nominee_reached_through_a_program_without_a_seed_is_refused`, `accept_without_a_nomination_is_refused`. A PDA is reachable only through its program, so its accept is the proof that it is deployed | test |

## Proposal scenarios

| Scenario | Satisfied by |
| --- | --- |
| Initialization | sample `init_through_the_seat_installs_the_sender_as_admin`, runner `init` |
| Re-initialization rejection | sample `a_replayed_init_is_refused_too`, `init_after_renounce_is_refused`, engine `install_refuses_a_held_slot` |
| Admin gated-call success | sample `the_admin_sets_the_admin_value`, minimal `the_deployer_initializes_anyone_sets_the_open_value_only_the_admin_the_other`, runner `admin setter` |
| Non-admin gated-call rejection | sample `a_signed_stranger_cannot_set_the_admin_value`, runner `stranger`, with `lez-authority/admin E103: the signing account is not the admin` in the sequencer log |
| Transfer success | sample `the_nominee_accepts_and_the_old_admin_is_out`, runner `accept` |
| Non-admin transfer rejection | sample `a_stranger_cannot_nominate`, `only_the_nominee_accepts`, engine `only_the_holder_nominates`, runner `nominee before accept` |
| Renounce success | sample `renounce_empties_the_slot_and_keeps_the_values`, runner `renounce` |
| Protected instructions rejected after renounce | sample `a_renounced_admin_refuses_every_change`, runner `after renounce`, with `E102: the admin is renounced` in the log |

## The 0.4 routing surface

Behaviour with no v0.2 counterpart, because LEZ 0.4 routes messages between actors.

| Behaviour | Satisfied by |
| --- | --- |
| The seat forwards only when the sender authorized, naming the program that reached it | sample `the_seat_forwards_naming_the_program_that_reached_it`, `an_unsigned_sender_is_refused_at_its_seat`, `a_program_without_the_seed_is_refused_at_the_seat` |
| The config accepts a forward only from an actor of the program, and only at the config | sample `a_forged_forward_sent_straight_to_the_config_is_refused`, `a_forward_sent_to_a_seat_is_refused` |
| A message that needs the admin cannot skip the seat | sample `init_sent_straight_to_the_config_is_refused`, `an_admin_message_sent_straight_to_the_config_is_refused`, engine `require_refuses_a_message_that_skipped_the_seat` |
| The init gate: the deployer, or the genesis key, at top level | sample `init_by_another_account_is_refused`, `init_by_the_deployer_through_a_program_is_refused`, `with_a_genesis_key_the_deployer_is_refused`, engine `another_account_cannot_install`, `the_deployer_reached_through_a_program_cannot_install`, runner `stranger init` with `E117` in the log |
| An empty config accepts only `Init` | sample `before_init_even_an_open_message_is_refused`, `before_init_the_admin_value_is_locked` |
| Open messages need no seat, and work through one | sample `anyone_sets_the_open_value`, `an_open_message_through_a_seat_works_too`, runner `open setter` |
| The admin's `via` is part of the admin | sample `a_pda_admin_acts_through_its_program`, `a_pda_admin_cannot_act_at_top_level`, `a_change_entered_from_another_program_is_refused`, engine `a_pda_holder_acts_through_its_program_only` |
| A nomination can be cancelled and replaced | sample `a_nomination_can_be_cancelled_and_replaced` |
| The hub: the config reaches a target, which accepts the config alone | sample `the_admin_sets_a_target_value_through_the_hub`, `a_stranger_cannot_reach_a_target`, `a_hub_message_sent_straight_to_a_target_is_refused`, `a_hub_message_from_another_actor_of_the_program_is_refused`, `a_hub_message_at_the_config_is_refused`, `a_target_value_sent_through_a_seat_is_refused`, `send_needs_the_admin_check_first`, runner `target setter` |
| A handler cannot change the slot | sample `a_handler_that_overwrites_the_slot_is_refused` |
| The codes are stable | engine `codes_are_stable` |

## Live runs

The runner's fourteen steps on a local dev sequencer, LEZ `dev` at `7e3f7f7`, `RISC0_DEV_MODE=1`, 2026-10-26: deploy, a stranger's `Init` refused, `Init`, the open setter, the admin setter, the target setter through the hub, a stranger refused, nominate, the nominee refused before accepting, accept, the new admin's setter, the old admin refused, renounce, a call after renounce refused. Every read-back matched, and the five refusals appeared in the sequencer log with their codes: E117 once, E103 three times, E102 once.

Not yet run live: a PDA admin, which needs a second program. Covered on host in both repos.

Every row above names at least one passing test. No known gaps.
